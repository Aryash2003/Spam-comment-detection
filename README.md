# Spam-comment-detection :
In this project we will be using multinomial Naive Bayes Algprithm to give a comment a tag as spam and ot spam.
Here we will be using ai21 api to paraphrase our comment and help our users get rid of gramattical errors thus making clear and error free 
comment to the user.
# Data flow of our code:
The Spam Detector.py is the main code containing the GUI(tkinter) to show different contents and take inputs from the user.
The ML_code.py is the machine learning code running in backend which is collecting data from user and providing optimum results using Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm.
API.py is the code which is responsible for paraphrasing operation of our project my taking input from GUI and providing output based on it.
Rest of the files are for buffer, checking and editing because sometimes ehen ML_code.py wont work then we can use Ml_code2.py.
